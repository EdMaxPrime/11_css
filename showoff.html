      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! And until then, I can never die? I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?<br>

      You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Shut up and take my money!<br>

      I never loved you. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…<br>

      Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Hey, whatcha watching? Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.<br>

      I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Look, last night was a mistake. Soon enough. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Okay, I like a challenge.<br>

      You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."<br>

      Large bet on myself in round one. Large bet on myself in round one. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!<br>

      Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!<br>

      Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. That's not soon enough! We don't have a brig. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. And when we woke up, we had these bodies.<br>

      She also liked to shut up! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.<br>

      Then we'll go with that data file! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Ask her how her day was. Then we'll go with that data file! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…<br>
